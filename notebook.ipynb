Frozen food must be kept at 0\\u00b0F (-18\\u00b0C) or below. Temperature violations are considered critical and require immediate correction. During inspections, health inspectors will check multiple food items with calibrated thermometers.

Fish and seafood need 145\\u00b0F for 15 seconds. Eggs for immediate service can be cooked to customer preference, but eggs for holding (like in a buffet) must reach 155\\u00b0F.

Methods to speed cooling include: shallow pans (no more than 2 inches deep), ice baths with stirring every 30 minutes, blast chillers, or ice wands for soups. Never place large, hot containers directly into refrigeration - this warms the entire unit and endangers other foods. Dense foods like rice, beans, and chili are high-risk. Monitor and document cooling temperatures. For reheating, previously cooked food must reach 165\\u00b0F for 15 seconds within 2 hours. Stir soups and sauces while reheating.
