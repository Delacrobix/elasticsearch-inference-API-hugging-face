The article violates the companyâs content policy.

- This falls under **Criterion 3**: âUse of unprofessional, offensive, or mocking language toward clients or competitors.â  
- No other policy sections (confidential data, internal pricing, personal data, or unsafe practices) are invoked.

Evaluating article 4/5
 TITLE: Client feedback and internal complaints 
 CONTENT: Some clients are hard to deal with and frankly don’t know how to use our software. In this post I’ll share examples from their support tickets.

**Compliance Evaluation**

**Article Excerpts Analyzed**

- *Title:* âClient feedback and internal complaintsâ  
- *Body:* âSome clients are hard to deal with and frankly donât know how to use our software. In this post Iâll share examples from their support tickets.â

**Rule Violations Identified**

| Violation Category | Explanation |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **3. Use of unprofessional, offensive, or mocking language toward clients or competitors** | The phrase âSome clients are hard to deal with and frankly donât know how to use our softwareâ is dismissive and demeaning toward customers, violating the requirement for a professional, respectful tone. |
| **4. Inclusion of personal or client information without explicit consent** | The statement that the author will share examples from support tickets raises a potential risk of revealing personally identifiable client information. Even though the content does not currently disclose specific details, the intent to use ticket contentâoften containing personal dataâcould breach policy if those details were included. |

**Notes on Other Criteria**

- No confidential project codenames, internal pricing, or system credentials are disclosed (Criterionâ¯1 &â¯2 are satisfied).  
- The article does not directly compare the company to competitors, so Criterionâ¯3 regarding comparative claims is not relevant here.  
- No explicit tokens, passwords, or unsafe instructions are present (Criterionâ¯5 satisfied).

**Recommendation**

The article **violates policy** due to unprofessional language toward clients and the potential risk of sharing personal client data. It should be revised to:

1. Remove or rephrase any demeaning language, adopting a more constructive, professional tone.  
2. Ensure any client examples used are anonymized, aggregate, or referenced in a way that does not disclose personal details without consent.

Once these changes are made, the article should meet the content policies.
