    "content": "Temperature control is the most common cause of foodborne illness outbreaks. Cold food must be held at 41°F (5°C) or below, and hot food at 135°F (57°C) or above. The danger zone between 41°F and 135°F allows rapid bacterial growth. Refrigeration equipment must maintain proper temperatures consistently, with backup thermometers in all units. Walk-in coolers require daily temperature logs. Frozen food must be kept at 0°F (-18°C) or below. Temperature violations are considered critical and require immediate correction. During inspections, health inspectors will check multiple food items with calibrated thermometers. If potentially hazardous foods (meat, dairy, eggs, cooked rice, cut produce) are found in the danger zone for more than 4 hours, they must be discarded. Restaurants must have metal-stem thermometers accurate to ±2°F available at all times.",

This is a critical violation that can cause severe foodborne illness. Establishments must use separate cutting boards, knives, and prep surfaces for raw proteins and ready-to-eat foods. Color-coded equipment is recommended: red for raw meat, yellow for raw poultry, green for produce, blue for seafood, white for dairy. All equipment must be washed, rinsed, and sanitized between uses. Raw proteins must be stored below ready-to-eat foods in refrigeration, with raw poultry on the bottom shelf. Never wash raw chicken or meat, as this spreads bacteria. Staff must wash hands for 20 seconds with soap after handling raw proteins. Use separate tongs and utensils for raw and cooked foods during service. Cross-contamination is the second leading cause of restaurant closures after temperature abuse.",

Cockroach evidence includes live insects, egg cases, fecal matter, and musty odors. If active infestation is found during inspection, the establishment typically has 24-48 hours to correct before re-inspection. Prevention measures include sealing all gaps larger than 1/4 inch, installing door sweeps, keeping dumpster areas clean, storing food 6 inches off the floor and away from walls, removing standing water, and fixing leaky pipes. Staff must report any pest sightings immediately. Keep pest control service records for at least 3 years. Fly strips should not be placed over food prep areas.",

Cross-contact occurs when allergen proteins transfer to allergen-free foods through shared equipment, surfaces, or utensils. Prevention measures: dedicate equipment for allergen-free prep when possible, clean and sanitize all surfaces between preparing allergen and allergen-free foods, use separate fryer oil for allergen items, store allergen ingredients separately with clear labels, and train staff to recognize allergens in all ingredients.

Wash hands and change gloves between handling allergen and non-allergen foods. Be cautious with garnishes: a wheat crouton on a gluten-free salad contaminates the entire dish. Check all ingredients for hidden allergens: soy lecithin in chocolate, milk derivatives in deli meats, wheat in soy sauce.
